# Circle 9 Solver
React site to help with solving [Circle 9 Puzzles](https://circle9puzzle.com/circle9/). The app uses the [technique guide](https://circle9puzzle.com/circle9/techniques.html) to determine the next move. You can enter the values yourself manually, or you can use the difficulty buttons and the date picker to load the puzzles for any day. If the "lock" toggle is unlocked you can enter values into the boxes, and when it's locked clicking a box will change the cell's state.

### How it works
1. Enter the values for the puzzle (or load today's puzzles using the `Intro`, `Standard`, `Advanced`, and `Expert` buttons)
